<h2>Acknowledge feelings</h2>

<p>A person suffering from dementia may see reality in a different way to you and it is often better to agree with them. Sometimes a correction will only cause more confusion.</p>
  <p>When you talk about something you’re going to do, give the information in small portions. In that way you can perhaps persuade the person to do what they say they don’t want to do.</p>
  <p>They may feel that they are living in another period of time that seems as real to them as yours does to you. It is not always certain that you should bring them back to the present.</p>
  <p>This can feel strange at first. But in a lot of cases this is calming. An example: Your wife thinks that she can pay the bill for a car that you sold a long time ago.</p>
  <p>Acknowledge her feelings and say: <i>“You mean the bill for the Volvo? I’ve taken care of that.”</i> In that way you acknowledge her feelings and take over responsibility for her problem – the unpaid bill.</p>
  <p>Let the information sink in and see if you can get her interested in something else. Otherwise there is a risk that she will once again be worried about the bill. Sometimes it can be better with a change of scene, e.g. go out for a walk.</p>
<p>If it’s a pattern of behaviour that occurs repeatedly and is difficult to break, contact the council’s support group, the dementia nurse or the needs assessor for help and support.</p>
