<h2>Ask in the right way</h2>

<p>With a dementia disease it can be difficult to understand the meaning of a word. Therefore the tone of your voice and your body language is especially important.</p>
<p>When suffering from dementia one’s self esteem can be influenced when one neither understands the questions nor can answer them. In the worst case it might be felt as some sort of homework test. 
  It is also important to be quiet and wait for an answer before continuing to speak. Let things take time.</p>
 <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  
<p>- If possible, sit down, make eye contact and speak calmly.</p>
    <p>- When the disease has advanced to some degree it can sometimes be difficult for the person with dementia to recognize those close to them. Avoid asking the question “Do you recognize me?”  Say instead: “Here comes your old friend Sven”.</p>
    <p>- Avoid the question “Do you remember when….” Instead talk about something that’s happened to get a conversation going.</p>
    <p>- Avoid yes and no questions as there is a chance that you’ll get no for an answer to questions that perhaps have not been understood.</p>
<p>- Don’t ask “Have you eaten?” ask instead “Are you hungry?”</p>
