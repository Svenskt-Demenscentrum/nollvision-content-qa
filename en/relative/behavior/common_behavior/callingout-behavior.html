<h2>Walking around</h2>

<p>A person with dementia is often restless and/or anxious and can walk around backwards and forwards. Perhaps pulling at a door handle or picking at things in wardrobes and drawers.</p>
  <p>This may be disturbing and strange to you, but it can have a meaning for the one who is ill. It can be a way of dealing with anxiety or just a way of using up excess energy. There is no need to be worried or to change their behaviour if they don’t seem worried or upset.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>If the situation becomes troublesome you can try and distract their attention with other activities:</p>
  <p>- Try doing everyday chores like vacuum cleaning, folding the laundry, washing the dishes, empty the rubbish bin or anything else the person is used to doing. The important thing to do is to capture their interest, not what the result of the activity is.</p>
  <p>- Look at photographs. To give support and help to the memory, write the names of those who are in the photo on the backside of the photo.</p>
<p>- Play their favourite music.</p>
  <p>- Give them some extra food and drink, to give energy and for a moment’s rest.</p>
  <p>- Being near to someone, physical contact or a warm wheat cushion on the stomach can be soothing.</p>
