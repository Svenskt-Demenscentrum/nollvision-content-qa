<h2>Sleeping problems</h2>

<p>A person with dementia can have sleeping problems. They may wake up and walk around at night. Perhaps they dress themselves to go to work or go out for a walk, they cannot always distinguish between night and day.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>- Try and find out why they can’t sleep. Are they cold, disturbed by noises or in pain?</p>
<p>- Prepare for bed time by reducing the lighting and sound in the evening.</p>
  <p>- Be close by and have some sort of physical contact with them.</p>
  <p>- Offer a sandwich or a glass of milk or something else they like.</p>
  <p>- If they are worried about something, try and find a solution to the problem. 
    Perhaps they want to go home, which in their world can be their childhood home. You can show them that it’s dark outside and say that you can go when the daylight comes. It might help to distract them with something you know they like, e.g. reading aloud from a book.</p>
  <p>- Try to see if they calm down if you give them a pillow, a warm wheat cushion, a heating pad or a soft toy.</p>
  <p>- Let them listen to soft music or watch TV. Remember that what is shown on TV can sometimes be confusing and cause worry.</p>
  <p>- Hum and sing together.</p>
  <p>- A custom built clock that clearly shows if it is day or night can help a person to understand when it’s time for bed.</p>
