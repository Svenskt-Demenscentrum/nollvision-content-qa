<h2>Hallucinations</h2>

  <p>Visual hallucinations can occur with dementia and are often a result of the damage to the brain. It can be frightening to see someone talk to someone who isn’t there.</p>
  <p>Not all people with dementia find hallucinations unpleasant. Contact a doctor if the hallucinations frighten, worry or in any other way disturb the person suffering from dementia.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
<p>- Some can be aware of the fact that they have hallucinations. In such cases you can say “I understand that you can see something, but I can’t see it”.</p>
  <p>- Others are conscious of the hallucinations and perceive them as absolutely real. In these cases it is often a waste of time to deny them. Instead you can listen and confirm what they see and say:  “I understand that you don’t like the animals. Shall we leave?”</p>
  <p>- Sometimes a white lie is necessary in order to restore calm. It might give you a bad conscience, but remember you are trying to make the best of a difficult situation.</p>
  <p>- Instead of telling a white lie you can confirm the feeling but not the hallucination: “I can see that you are frightened, how can I help you?”</p>
