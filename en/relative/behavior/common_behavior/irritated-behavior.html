<h2>Irritated and angry</h2>

<p>The person with dementia can be moody. They’ve become impatient and can have sudden bursts of anger. Sometimes they won’t accept help.</p>
  <p>A dementia illness due to brain damage can make it difficult for a person to concentrate and understand what is happening. 
    It can be difficult to sort out all the different impressions and one can become tired and irritable. Some can have difficultly perceiving where other people are in the room.</p>
  <p>An example: A man with dementia is sitting in a wheelchair. You’ve said hello and stand behind the wheelchair. He can’t see you. You start to push the wheelchair he gets angry and start threshing his arms about. Why is that?  Perhaps he's not conscious of the fact that he is  sitting in a wheelchair or that you are standing behind him.</p>
  <p>The situation is frightening when the ground suddenly starts to move. Perhaps he thinks that someone is pushing him and becomes frightened. There are of course many other reasons for outrage and indignation. See the tips below:</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>- Try and find out if it’s because of something physical. Is he in pain or perhaps he need to go the toilet?</p>
  <p>- Try to avoid what it is that causes the outbreak and irritation. Lower the volume, turn of the sound from the TV, radio, dishwasher or washing machine if the sound seems to cause stress.</p>
  <p>- Avoid discussion or correction. Don’t ask too many questions or give too much information all at one time. Try to interpret what he is trying to say or mean.</p>
<p>- Let him be by himself if he wants to.</p>
  <p>- Confirm his feelings by saying: “I can see that you are angry, can I help you?”</p>
  <p>- Don’t surprise or approach quickly. If he is suddenly surprised or frightened, he can react in a manner of defence and hit you.</p>
  <p>- Distract by playing music or talking about old times, look in a photo album.</p>
  <p>- Try giving a snack, perhaps he's hungry or have a low level of glucose.</p>
