<h2>Apathetic and indifferent</h2>

<p>The person suffering from dementia sits quietly seeming not to care about what’s happening around them. They’ve lost interest in and have no motivation for taking part in anything.</p>
  <p>If this problem continues for a long time contact the doctor who can look over medicines and determine whether the problem is due to depression. It’s also important to eliminate pain or any other physical ailment as the cause.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>- As far as possible encourage and make it easier for them to feel that they are making their own decisions.</p>
  <p>- Praise and confirm. Using humour can be liberating.</p>
  <p>- A thing from the past or a photo can arouse interest and participation.</p>
  <p>- Let them listen to their favourite music.</p>
  <p>- Do things together e.g. make food. Stir in the saucepan while someone else puts in the ingredients.</p>
  <p>- Be close by and have some sort of physical contact e.g. a gentle hand massage.</p>
  <p>- Make it easy for them to carry out everyday activities. Plan ahead e.g. putting out clothes in the order in which they will be put on, or slice the cheese so that it will be easier for them to make their own sandwich.</p>
  <p>- Ask one question at a time. Wait for an answer before you ask something else.</p>
