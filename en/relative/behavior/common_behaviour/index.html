  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <p>For persons with dementia, anger, anxiety or sleeping disorders can suddenly emerge without any apparent reason. 
    These can be expressions for another illness, pain, stress, environmental factors, under stimulation or the brain damage itself.</p>
 <p>It is often difficult to treat the changes in behaviour. 
    It is therefore a good thing to share common knowledge and experiences with colleagues, not the least because it will enable you to support each other at work.</p>
<p>The life history is a good base from which to start. Good contact with relatives is important in preventing and treating changes in behaviour. 
  Adapting your approach and the way you communicate will make some situations easier to handle.</p>
