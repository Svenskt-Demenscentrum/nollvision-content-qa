<h2>Minimize impressions</h2>

<p>A person with dementia has difficulty in interpreting stimuli. Sound can seem louder and depth perception can deteriorate. A person can have difficulty interpreting and finding their way in their surroundings. 
  Stimuli can be difficult to sort out and put in a logical context. The brain has to work at high speed.</p>
  <p>You can help the person with dementia by adapting the living arrangements. Try to limit stimuli and create a calm environment.</p>
<p>- Sudden loud noises can be frightening. Turn down disturbing sounds from for instance TV, radio or kitchen machines.</p>
  <p>- Limit visual stimuli. When eating, for example, don't put more than needed on the plate. If there are too many things there is a risk that the caretaker will mix things up. Contrasting colours can be used to make perception easier.</p>
  <p>- Dark areas in a floor, or a dark carpet, may be perceived as being indented compared to the rest of the floor. It might be a good idea to remove a dark carpet that perhaps is seen as a ditch or a hole.</p>
  <p>- The sense of touch is what develops first and remains throughout life. Physical contact can create peace and quiet and give a feeling of wellbeing.</p>
