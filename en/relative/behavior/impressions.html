<h2>Minimize impressions</h2>

<p>A person with dementia has difficulty in interpreting stimuli. Sound can seem louder and depth perception can deteriorate. A person can have difficulty interpreting and finding their way around in their surroundings. 
  Stimuli can be difficult to sort out and put in a logical context. The brain has to work at high speed. You can help the person with dementia by adapting the environment. Try to limit stimuli and create a calm environment.</p>
<p>Sudden loud noises can be frightening. Turn down disturbing sounds from e.g. TV, radio or kitchen machines.</p>
  <p>Limit visual stimuli, e.g. at mealtimes only take up what is going to be used. If there are too many things there is a risk that your relative will mix things up. Contrasting colours can be used to make it easier to perceive</p>
  <p>Dark colours, areas such as floors or mats can be interpreted as being submerged in relationship to lighter areas. It can be a good idea to remove a dark mat that perhaps is seen as a ditch or a hole.</p>
  <p>The sense of touch is what develops first and remains throughout life. Physical contact can create peace and quiet and give a feeling of wellbeing.</p>
