  <h2>Changes in behaviour</h2>

  <p>When a person has dementia it often leads to a change in behaviour. To see a close one change can be frustrating. The changes can appear suddenly and without any apparent reason. Some are anxious, angry or have difficulty in sleeping or perhaps do not understand that they need help.</p>
 <p>Some patterns of behaviour can be an expression of another physical illness, pain, stress, shortage of stimulation or unhappiness. Others can be because of brain damage.</p>
  <p>Adapting your way of responding and communicating can make some situations easier to handle.</p>
