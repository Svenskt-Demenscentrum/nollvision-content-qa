<h2>Strengthen what is healthy</h2>

<p>Most people want to feel that they belong and that they make a contribution. This is also the case even if one has dementia and are dependent upon help. Otherwise there is a risk that one avoids contact, become passive and rapidly lose different capabilities.</p>
<h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  
<p>- Try and not take over too much, even if the person with dementia isnâ€™t fully capable of doing ordinary everyday household activities.</p>
    <p>- Consolidate/Build on what is healthy and let them do what they are still capable of doing: make the bed, peel potatoes, collect the post, shop or be in the garden.</p>
    <p>- At a later stage of the disease walks, reading aloud, music and being in different social environments can create a feeling of belonging.</p>
    <p>- Being near to someone and physical contact or being given help with hair and nails can also give a feeling of wellbeing.</p>
    <p>- Contact your needs assessor to find out about possible day activities with different sorts of social and physical activity.</p>
