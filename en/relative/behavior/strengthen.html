<h2>Strengthen what is healthy</h2>

<p>Most people want to feel that they belong and that they make a contribution. This is also the case for people with dementia who are dependent on help. Otherwise there is a risk that they avoid contact, become passive and rapidly lose different capabilities.</p>
<h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  
<p>- Try not to take over too much, even if the person with dementia isnâ€™t fully capable of doing ordinary everyday household activities.</p>
    <p>- Focus on what is healthy and let them do what they are still capable of doing, maybe making the bed, peeling potatoes, emptying the letter box, shopping or spending time in the garden.</p>
    <p>- At a later stage of the disease walks, reading aloud, music and being in different social environments can create a feeling of belonging.</p>
    <p>- Being near someone physical contact or getting help with hair and nails can also give a feeling of wellbeing.</p>
    <p>- Contact your needs assessor to find out about possible day activities with different sorts of social and physical activities.</p>
