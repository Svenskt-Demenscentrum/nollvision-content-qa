<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Helping a person with a dementia can be a great challenge. It is not always easy to know where to turn to get the help you need. Remember that as a carer you have the legal right to help and support. Here is a list of the different support that is available:</p>
<h3><strong>District nurse/ doctor</strong></h3>
<p>If the person with dementia has a change in behaviour which is difficult to cope with it may be necessary for a medical evaluation.  Contact the health centre or home health care.</p>
<h3><strong>Curator</strong></h3>
    <p>A curator gives advice, support and information and can even coordinate contacts with other authorities. You can also be given counselling. Contact the health centre to come in contact with a curator.</p>
    <h3><strong>Occupational therapist</strong></h3>
    <p>An occupational therapist can prescribe and test different means of aid as well as giving concrete tips which can ease everyday living for both you and the person with dementia (an electronic calendar/diary, medical reminder, stove guard or GPS-alarm). 
        You can also get suggestions on how your home and surroundings can be adapted to your needs (the bathroom, thresholds).</p>
<h3><strong>Family support</strong></h3>
    <p>There is Family support in every council. Here you can be given advice and support on what you and the person with dementia have the right to. Many councils offer information on dementia and also counselling individually or in a group.</p>
    <h3><strong>Dementia nurse</strong></h3>
    <p>Some councils have dementia nurses who can give information on dementia and tips on treatment. They can also give support in difficult situations e.g. if your relative lacks insight into his situation and will not accept help. They can even guide you between the different 
        caregivers.</p>
   <h3><strong>Needs assessor</strong></h3>
    <p>There are needs assessors in every council. They assess what help is needed based on your needs. It can be home help service, daytime activities or another sort of housing. 
        The needs assessor can even grant help so that you can carry out errands or have the possibility of resting.</p>
    <h3><strong>Dementia team</strong></h3>
    <p>Some councils have a dementia team. They can consist of different working groups e.g. an assistant nurse, an occupational therapist and a dementia nurse. 
        They have specialised knowledge about dementia and can give advice and support to the person with dementia, relatives and personnel.</p>
    <h3><strong>Specialised Home service help</strong></h3>
    <p>Some councils have home-service help groups that have a broad knowledge of dementia and treatment. Contact the needs assessor for help.</p>
    <h3><strong>Meeting venues for friends and family</strong></h3>
    <p>The Dementia Association and the Alzheimerâ€™s Association have local groups in many places through out the country. Here you can, amongst other things, be given support and information on the rights to which you and the person suffering from dementia are entitled.</p>
