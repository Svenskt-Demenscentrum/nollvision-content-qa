<h2>What is deemed as restraint or force?</h2>

  <h4>Restraining a person</h4>
  <p>A relative or member of the nursing staff restraining and holding on to a person against their will.</p>
<h4>Locking the door</h4>
  <p>Most people lock the door at home. But locking someone in can be seen as restraint, even if the purpose is to protect. If the person suffering from dementia cannot be at home alone, extra help at home can be a solution.</p>
  <h4>Physical restraints</h4>
  <p>Using a belt or a table to stop someone from getting up is regarded as restraint.</p>
  <h4>Medication</h4>
  <p>Using routine medication to keep a person calm can be a coercive measure. If a person is angry or anxious, other reasons for this, e.g. an infection or pain, must first be ruled out before considering giving sedatives.</p>
 <h4>Alarm and GPS</h4>
  <p>Precautions such as video surveillance, GPS or an alarm can be regarded as force or restraint if they are used against a personâ€™s will. If a person has insight and gives his consent, these can be good aids and provide security.</p>
