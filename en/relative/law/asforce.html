<h2>What is deemed as force</h2>

  <h4>Restraining a person</h4>
  <p>A relative or member of the nursing staff restrain and hold on to a person against their will.</p>
<h4>Locking the door</h4>
  <p>Most people lock the door at home. But locking someone in can be seen as restraining, even if the motive is to protect. If the one suffering from dementia cannot be at home alone, extra help at home can be a solution.</p>
  <h4>Physical restraints</h4>
  <p>Using a belt or a table to stop someone from getting up is deemed a restraining precaution.</p>
  <p>Medication</p>
  <p>Using medication as a matter of routine to keep a person calm can be a coercive measure. If a person is angry or filled with anxiety other reasons for this e.g. an infection or pain must first be ruled out before considering giving sedatives.</p>
 <h4>Alarm and GPS</h4>
