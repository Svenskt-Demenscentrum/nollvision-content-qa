<h2>Power of attorney</h2>

<p>On the onset of dementia it can be a good idea to write a general power of attorney. This means that you as a carer have the right to keep watch over a personâ€™s interests and take care of practical matters such as paying bills.</p>
  <p>It is also a good thing to see that the person with dementia has legitimate identity papers. Plan for the future by contacting a legal adviser or talk to your needs assessor.</p>
  <h3>Proxy future</h3>
  <p>When this no longer applies a proxy future can come in handly. It's content can be the same as in the general power of attorney but applies also when the person with dementia no longer can make informed decisions. 
    It's a good idea to have the proxy future made at the same time as the general power of attorney.</p>
  <h3>Family mandate</h3>
  <p>In case there are no proxies of any kind, family members may still for example pay bills and make tax returns for the person with demenstia.</p>
