<h2>Power of attorney</h2>
<h4>General power of attorney</h4>
<p>As early as possible, it is a good idea to write a general power of attorney. This means that you as a caregiver have the right to protect a personâ€™s interests, and take care of practical matters such as paying bills.</p>
  <p>It is also a good thing to make sure that the person with dementia has legitimate identity papers. Plan for the future by contacting a legal adviser or talk to your needs assessor.</p>
  <h4>Lasting power of attorney</h4>
  <p>The content can be the same as in the general power of attorney, but it starts to be valid when the person with dementia no longer can make informed decisions. 
    It's a good idea to have this document made at the same time as the general power of attorney.</p>
  <h4>Family mandate</h4>
  <p>In case there are no proxies of any kind, family members may still for example pay bills and make tax returns for the person with demenstia.</p>
