<h2>Consent</h2>

<p>The basis of all health care is that every person must give their consent to their own health care. Being close to the one who has dementia, it is only natural to want to be involved in the process of care. 
  On the other hand, you cannot give your consent for the one who is ill, or demand that the nursing staff do something against that personâ€™s will.</p>
<p>However, your knowledge is helpful for the staff when it comes to understanding your relative and treating him or her in the best way.</p>
