<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>A person suffering from dementia often has a weak sense of self-esteem. To be forced against one’s will influences dignity, self-respect and identity. 
  Not being allowed to move around freely can, in the long run, lead to physical problems such as weaker muscles and poor balance. In difficult situations it is important to seek help from the council’s family support team, the dementia nurse or the needs assessor.</p>
