  <h2>Coping</h2>
  
  <p>“I went home from the doctor with my father in one hand and the Alzheimer diagnosis in the other. I thought: How shall I cope with this….</p>
  <p>A dementia illness changes not only the life of the one who is ill. A relationship is no longer what it was before and it can take some time to find one’s roll as a relative. To take care of and treat with respect and patience can be a difficult task.</p>
<p>Many feel guilty for not being sufficient. As a carer, being angry, filled with sorrow, frustration and tiredness is natural and very common.</p>

  <p4>What shall I do?</p4>

  <p>To be able to cope it is important that to seek help in time. Make sure that you have a contact person e.g. the district nurse, curator, dementia nurse or assistance officer to whom you can turn when the need arises.</p>
  <p>If you have support it can be easier to motivate the person with dementia to accept help even when they say no. Both you and the person with a dementia illness deserve a life that feels secure and meaningful.</p>
  <p>If possible, it is a good thing to inform friends and relatives about dementia illnesses. Not only to enable them to understand but also to be able to give support.</p>
  <p>In order for you to cope and maintain your health you must take care of yourself and find out what rights you have with regards to help. You as a carer are not obliged to nurse. Every council, on the other hand, is obliged to offer support both to you and the one who is ill.</p>
