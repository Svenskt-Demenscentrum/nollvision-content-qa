  <h2>Coping</h2>
  
  <p>“I went home from the doctor with my father in one hand and the Alzheimer diagnosis in the other. I thought: How will I cope with this …?"</p>
  <p>A dementia illness changes not only the life of the one who is ill. The relationship is no longer what it was before and it can take some time to find one’s role as a partner. To take care of and treat someone with respect and patience can be a difficult task.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to feel guilty for not being sufficient help for your family member. As a caregiver, being angry, filled with sorrow, frustration and tiredness is natural and very common.</p>

  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

  <p>To be able to cope, it is important to seek help in time. Make sure that you have a contact person, like the district nurse, curator, dementia nurse or assistance officer to whom you can turn when the need arises.</p>
  <p>If you have support it can be easier to motivate the person with dementia to accept help even when they say no. Both you and the person with dementia deserve a life that feels secure and meaningful.</p>
  <p>If possible, it is a good thing to inform friends and relatives about dementia. Not only to enable them to understand but also to be able to give support.</p>
  <p>In order for you to cope and maintain your health you must take care of yourself and find out what rights you have regarding help. Being a caregiver, you are not obliged to act as a nurse. Every council, on the other hand, is obliged to offer support both to you and the one who is ill.</p>
