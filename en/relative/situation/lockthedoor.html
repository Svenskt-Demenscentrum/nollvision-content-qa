  <h2>Can I lock the door?</h2>
  
  <p>“My wife is very anxious and always wants to be with me. Earlier, when I have left home she has sometimes gone out and not found her way home. In spite of it not feeling right, I now lock the front door when I go out.”</p>
<p>It is not unusual for people with dementia to have difficulty with orientation. Damage to the brain makes it difficult to interpret one’s surroundings. This is difficult for a carer to cope with.</p>
  <p>According to the law it is in principle never allowed to lock someone in, whatever the reason. In special circumstances, if it’s a matter of preventing an acute hazardous situation, it may be necessary.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>- What is the situation like today? Do they have enough to do, household duties, listening to music or something else?</p>
<p>- Give them a simple cell phone that is easy to use</p>
<p>- Contact the needs assessor in your council for other possible solutions e.g. daily walks, home help service or a daily activity.</p>
  <p>- Contact the occupational therapist at the health care centre and discuss solutions such as a GPS-alarm or an emergency transmitter. These are aids to help find a missing person. Agreement is necessary if these are to be used.</p>
