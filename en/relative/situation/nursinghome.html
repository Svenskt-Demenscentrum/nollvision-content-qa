  <h2>He doesn’t want to move</h2>
  
  <p>“Father needs help around the clock now and would be able to get that in a nursing home. He says he manages well by himself at home. But he wouldn’t manage a day without me and the home service help. Soon I won’t be able to manage any longer”.</p>
 <p>People with dementia can lack insight as to their need for help and believe they can manage themselves. Many families want to help as much as possible. In the end, they might not have the strength to continue.</p>
  <p>As a caregiver you are in a difficult situation. According to the law, it is the one who is ill who has to apply for help and support. According to the law, you cannot force someone to accept help.</p>
 <p>Nor are you responsible for taking care of them even if you are married, related or live together. As a caregiver you need support in getting the person with dementia to apply for and accept help.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>- Get help in time!  Ask the council’s support group for advice on what you should do.</p>
<p>- Talk to the district nurse, needs assessor or the council’s dementia nurse.</p>
<p>- Perhaps you can start by going to look at new accommodation together</p>
