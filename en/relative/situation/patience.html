  <h2>I lose my patience</h2>
  
  <p>“My wife asks the same question over and over again all the time. I don’t dare to tell anyone, but soon I won’t be able to cope anymore”.</p>
  <p>It’s completely normal to lose your patience if you’re never left in peace or you feel stressed. The risk of losing your patience increases if you don’t get enough rest. That is not good for either of you.</p>

  <p4>What shall I do?</p4>

  <ul>
    
    <li>If the situation is acute, go away for a moment. Perhaps you can go out and take a breath of fresh air.</li>
  <li>Phone someone who knows about your situation and have a chat when the opportunity arises.</li>
    <li>Speak to the assistance officer and find out what help you can get:
    <p>- home-help service so you can do your errands or rest</p><br/>
      <p>- an escort who can go out with your relative so you can rest</p><br/>
      <p>-  more assistance in the home</p><br/>
      <p>-  daytime activities for the one with dementia a few days a week</p></li>
  <li>Contact the council and ask what family support is available</li>
  <li>Contact the health centre, the district nurse or curator for advice and support</li>
  </ul>
