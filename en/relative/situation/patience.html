  <h2>I lose my patience</h2>
  
  <p>“My husband asks the same question over and over again. Soon I won’t be able to cope anymore”.</p>
  <p>It’s completely normal to lose your patience if you’re never left in peace or you feel stressed. The risk of losing your patience increases if you don’t get enough rest. That is not good for either of you.</p>

  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
    
    <p>If the situation is acute, go away for a moment. Perhaps you can go out and take a breath of fresh air.</p>
  <p>Phone someone who knows about your situation and have a chat when you get a chance. Speak to the assistance officer and find out what help you can get, for example:</p>
    <ul><li>home-help service so you can do your errands or rest</li></br>
      <li>an assistant who can go out with your relative so you can rest</li></br>
      <li> more assistance in the home</li></br>
     <li>Daytime activities for the person with dementia a few days a week</li></br>
  <li>Contact the council and ask what family support is available.</li></br>
<li>Contact the health centre, the district nurse or curator for advice and support.</li></ul>
