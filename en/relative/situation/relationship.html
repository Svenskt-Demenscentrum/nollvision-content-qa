  <h2>A new relationship</h2>
  
  <p>“When I visited my wife she was sitting with another man and held his hand. The staff looked embarrassed, but did nothing. We have been married for 50 years. How could this happen?”</p>
  <p>It sometimes happens that a person with dementia can develop feelings for another person. It can be tough and you can feel both sad and embarrassed. This is not an unusual situation.</p>
  <p>It is important to remember that this is due to the disease and that they may have forgotten a great deal about their life, even their marriage. The need for love and affection is still there and as a result new relationships of this kind develop when memory fails.</p>
  <p>The staff has no right to keep your partner apart from new relationships. Nor can a person be forced to move.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>- In cooperation with the staff you can try and find a solution that works for everyone. Perhaps you can agree on you phoning before you come to visit.</p>
<p>- If you think the situation is difficult and want to talk with an impartial person, contact the family support group or counsellor. In many places there are discussion groups where you can meet other people who also have someone close to them suffering from dementia.</p>
