  <h2>She needs a restraining belt</h2>
  
  <p>“My mother tries to get up from her wheelchair and has fallen a few times. I’m worried that she may break a leg. Why can’t she have a belt so that she can’t fall?”</p>
<p>Naturally both you and the staff want to protect and prevent accidents. But even safety precautions can be counted as force if the person they concern does not give their consent.</p>
  <p>As a person with dementia can have difficulty giving their consent it is better if the situation can be avoided. Being belted and not understanding why can cause worry and anxiety.</p>
  <p>As well as that it can, in the long run, cause both weakening of the muscles and impaired balance. You have important information and knowledge about the person suffering from dementia that the staff needs to know to enable them to prevent accidents without using force.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>Talk to the staff about your concern. Why is mother so anxious? Is she bored? Can there be some physical problem?</p>
<p>Together perhaps you and the staff can come up with ideas to prevent accidents happening e.g.</p>
<p>- keep them company and try and hold a conversation</p>
  <p>- take walks</p>
  <p>- physical contact e.g. a gentle clap, light massage to help calm down</p>
  <p>- music</p>
  <p>- put something into their hands like drying dishes, reading a newspaper or holding a cushion.</p>
