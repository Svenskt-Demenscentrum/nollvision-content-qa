  <h2>He refuses to shower</h2>
  
  <p>“My husband has always been meticulous regarding his personal hygiene. Now he refuses to take a shower”</p>
  <p>There can be a lot of different reasons for a person not wanting to take a shower. For example: it’s too cold in the bathroom, they’re ashamed of showing themselves naked or are thinking of other things and feel that they are being abruptly interrupted when you ask.</p>

  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
<ul></ul>
<li> Avoid direct questions like “Do you want to take a shower?” If he doesn’t understand the question you will probably get a “no”. Say instead “Come on, let’s go to the bathroom so you can shave.”</li>
  <li> Show him the towels, let him feel them. Then take the next step “Feel if the water is warm enough” “Let me help you take off your sweater“. This way you can lead him into the shower step by step. It’s important to create a safe situation.</li>
  <li> Make sure the bathroom is warm, e.g. let the warm water run for a while.</li>
  <li> It’s important to try and keep calm and to have plenty of time. Plan so that everything you need is close at hand.</li>
  <li> Use earlier showering habits but make adjustments according to his present mood. If it’s not possible to shower today, perhaps it will be tomorrow.</li>
  <li> Give him something to eat beforehand.</li></ul>
  <p>Perhaps you can entice him by showing him a deodorant or an after shave that he likes.</p>
