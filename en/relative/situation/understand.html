  <h2>The staff don’t understand</h2>
  
  <p>“My husband was meticulous with his appearance before he became ill. Now he sits there with food stains on his jumper when I visit him. I have asked to the staff that they should change his jumper when it is dirty.”</p>
  <p>Perhaps you wonder why the staff don’t change his dirty jumper or, in other situations, don’t do what you ask them to do. It can be because they are waiting for the right opportunity so as not to frustrate or annoy the person concerned.</p>
  <p>Being forced to do something against their will can humiliate and make a person angry. These negative feelings can remain for many hours, despite the fact that the event itself has long been forgotten.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>- As a caregiver you know the person as he was before and the staff knows him as he is today. That is why it is important that you speak to each other.</p>
<p>- Perhaps together you can find a practical solution that suits everyone.</p>
  <p>- Think about what is important. If your husband doesn’t seem to worry over the stains perhaps a change of jumper can wait.</p>
