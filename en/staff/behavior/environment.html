  <h2>Environment</h2>

  <p>With a dementia disease, the brain damage can make it more strenuous to understand and interpret one’s surroundings. For example, a person with dementia might be more sensitive to different sounds.</p>
  <p>It is therefore important to limit the number of different stimuli, and create a calm and welcoming atmosphere. By adapting the surroundings for persons with dementia, it will be easier for them to feel secure and to find their way around.</p>
  <p>Remember that you are also a part of the environment. Your way of moving and facial expressions are significant and can be interpreted as both positive and negative. 
    It is important to try to convey a sense of security and friendliness, when communicating with persons with dementia.</p>

<p>- Minimize sounds. A door that slams shut can seem frightening. A dishwashing machine, a fan or sounds from an open window can also be disturbing. Think about the way in which you and your colleagues talk to each other.</p>
  <p>- Limit visual stimuli. Only lay the table with what is necessary for the meal. Don’t put more cutlery, glass or plates on the table than needed. Serve one dish at a time. 
    Remember to use contrasting colours so that it will be easier to see and interpret, for example, a white fish dish on a coloured plate.</p>
  <p>- Explain in simple words what is going to happen, for example: “It’s now twelve o’clock and time for lunch.” Don’t ask questions of fact. Instead ask if a person is hungry and show the food or a sandwich.</p>
  <p>- If someone is anxious, say “I’ll take care of this, don’t you worry about it”. Remember that your body language often reveals if you are irritated or stressed.</p>
  <p>- Avoid sudden moves or speaking too quickly, or above a person’s head. Use simple language.</p>
  <p>How would you adapt the environment to prevent anxiety?</p>
