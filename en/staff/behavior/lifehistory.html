  <h2>Life history</h2>

  <p>Conversing with a person who has dementia is not always easy. By talking to relatives you can get help with information about what is or has been important in the person’s life.</p>
  <p>With the person’s life history as a base and the knowledge you have about the person it will be easier for you to work person-centred and prevent difficult situations from arising.</p>
  <p>How do you prevent a situation from arising such as, for example, a person starts to pull at a door handle and wants to go home?  From the example with Elsa, what would you have done?</p>
  <p>Have you used the person’s life history or information from relatives at any time to avoid using force or restraint?</p>
