  <h2>Mapping</h2>

  <p>An important part of the work is to find out what initiates the behavioural changes. Family or friends often have information about the person with dementia and it is important to make note of what they say.</p>
  <p>When the mapping is complete there will be both a basis on which to work in a preventative way and at the same time suggestions on how to respond to the changes in behaviour.</p>
  <p>Here is a mapping example. Consider if you would have done anything differently.</p>
<h3>Elsa, 89 years old</h3>

  <p>To start with, there is important information to be gained from Elsa’s life history. Elsa was diagnosed with Alzheimer when she was 82. For the last three years she has lived in a nursing home for people with dementia.</p>
  <p>Elsa is married, has two children and five grandchildren, all of whom visit her regularly. She worked in an office, and in her spare time sang in a choir, spent time with her family and worked in the garden.</p>
  <p>During the past week, Elsa has become more anxious and sleeps badly at night. She is always seeking company and has difficulty in settling. The staff has had to stop Elsa from following them around when they need to help other people. 
    At the moment it appears to be a very difficult situation.</p>
  <h3>Triggers</h3>
  <p>What could provoke Elsa’s anxiety and sleeplessness? This is how a mapping can be carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Medical</strong>: Is Elsa in pain? Constipation or problems urinating? Something else?</p>
  <p><strong>Functional</strong>: Does Elsa have problems with her sight or hearing? Is she sensitive to sound?</p>
  <p><strong>Psychosocial</strong>: Is Elsa getting enough stimulation and company? How do we communicate with her?</p>
  <p><strong>Cognitive</strong>: Has Elsa’s dementia deteriorated? Do the changes occur at a specific time of day?</p>
  <p><strong>Psychological</strong>: Does she suffer from anxiety? What habits does Elsa have around sleeping and being active? How does she relax?</p>
  <p><strong>The physical environment</strong>: Can Elsa find her way around in her surroundings? What is a “homelike” environment for Elsa? Is there any place where she feels calm?</p>
  <h3>Elsa’s present situation</h3>
  <p>What has changed in Elsa’s condition? When does she feel fine and when does she not?</p>
  <p><strong>Describe situations when the person in question is satisfied and feels fine.</strong></p>
  <p>Elsa is calm when she is with her relatives. She is also calm when a member of staff sings with her or when she goes for a walk with someone.</p>
  <p><strong>Describe situations when the person in question is worried and disconcerted.</strong></p>
  <p>She is worried in the afternoons, especially when it’s time for her relatives to go home and the hours after their visit.</p>
  <h3>What happened?</h3>
  <p>On Thursday the staff was on in-service training. When it was time for her relatives to go home, Elsa became anxious and unsettled. She wanted to go with them, held onto the door handle and screamed “Let me out”. A supply worker tried to distract her but was pushed away. 
    A regular member of the staff took over and after a moment managed to calm Elsa down with some coffee and cake. But Elsa was upset again, and in the evening she walked back and forth, frustrated and angry. The nurse gave her a prescribed sedative, to be used only when necessary.</p>
  <h3>The result of the mapping</h3>
  <p>Elsa probably feels insecure and anxious when she doesn’t recognise the people around her. She also seems sensitive to loud noises. It is possible that Elsa lacks stimulation and probably has difficulties interaction with others as a result of the deterioration of her disease.</p>
<h3>Preventative measures</h3>
  <p>Based on Elsa’s present situation, the following measures have been planned:</p>
  <p>- When relatives go home after a visit, the staff will immediately take over to prevent anxiety.</p>
  <p>- Daily walks with a member of staff or a relative.</p>
  <p>- A contact person or member of staff, who knows Elsa well, will do some daily activities with her, such as browsing through a gardening book, singing or listening to music.</p>
  <p>- In a calm place in the day room, the staff will gather Elsa and some of the other people in the nursing home, so that they can socialize and keep each other company. The staff will take turns sitting with the group, so that Elsa and the others can feel calm and secure.</p>
  <p>- Elsa will be given the chance to watch TV and take an evening snack before she goes to bed at eleven, as was her former habit.</p>
