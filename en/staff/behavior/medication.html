  <h2>Medication</h2>

  <p>At some time or another, nine out of ten people with dementia will show behavioural or psychological symptoms (Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)). One reason for BPSD could be side effects of medication.</p>
  <p>With increasing age, the bodyâ€™s ability to absorb, break down and rid itself of medicine changes. Medicine such as certain sedatives and sleeping pills could remain in the body and be active for a long period of time.</p>
  <p>This is one of the reasons why older people often feel drowsy and mentally affected even the day after taking medicine. In some cases it may nonetheless be necessary to medicate BPSD symptoms, for example psychosis or aggression. 
    But the effect of these medicines must be continually evaluated. The aim is to stop taking them as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Do you have any experience of being able to replace sedatives with care interventions?</p>
