<h2>If restraint is used</h2>
<p>There is no legal support for force or restraint. Sometimes they may seem necessary as the last resort and as a temporary solution in a serious and acute situation. In these cases, the ambition must be to cease using force as soon as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Staffing and supervision.</b> If possible increase the number of staff. Provide regular supervision and attention.</li>
  <li><b>Stop using force or restraint.</b> Evaluate possible risks for the person, other residents, visitors and staff. Stop using force or restraint as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><b>Identify the trigger mechanisms.</b> What could have led up to the situation? Discuss this with colleagues, with relatives and if possible with the person concerned. Think about how the behaviour can be prevented.</li>
<li><b>Documentation and interaction strategies.</b> Document the situation and the interaction strategies that can be used if the situation arises again. 
  Revise the social and medical records so that everyone works in the same way.</li>
  <li><b>File a report on adverse incidents or injuries while in care.</b> Report, at first-hand, to your supervisor if something happens, e.g. you have to take hold of, restrain, a person who is about to hit another person. According to Lex Sarah and Lex Maria you must report the incident as adverse incident if force and/or restraint have been used against a personâ€™s wishes. 
    If the incident was serious it must be reported to The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO).</li>
