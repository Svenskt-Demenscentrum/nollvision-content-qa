<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Working with people who have dementia can be challenging and sometimes difficult to cope with. 
  Therefore, it is important to set aside time for reflection meetings where everyone should be given the opportunity to describe and speak of difficult situations.</p>
  <p>Members of the team should support each other and together try to find strategies where everyone thinks and works in the same way.</p>
  <p>To share knowledge and experience is an integral part of working as a team. Plan scheduled meetings and appoint a reflection-leader. 
    A reflection meeting can be carried out like this, (according to a model by G. Gibbs, 1988).</p>
  <ul>
<li>Description: What happened?</li>
    <li>Feelings: What did you think? What did you feel?</li>
    <li>Evaluation: What was positive? What was negative?</li>
    <li>Analysis: What have you learned from this?</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Could you have acted in another way?</li>
    <li>Plan of action: If it happens again, what will you do then?</li>  
  </ul>
