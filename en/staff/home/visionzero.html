<h2>Vision zero– How?</h2>

<p>How can we work towards a dementia care without restraint? A work place policy is a good tool to have to enable the implementation of a vision zero. 
  Remember that creating routines and embodying them is a continuous ongoing process.</p>
<p>Here are some tips and advice.</p>
  <h4>nformation</h4>
  <p>How can my colleagues and I make sure that everyone is informed about the vision zero?</p>
  <p>-Discuss what a vision zero entails at every staff meeting in order to embody the way in which to work</p>
  <p>- Inform new colleagues about what a vision zero implies at your workplace. Give examples on how you work in a preventive manner to 
    hinder difficult behavioural situations from arising.</p>
  <p>- Give regular information to next of kin when; the person with dementia moves in to a care home, 
    when the contact person communicates with them and during common meetings.</p>
  <h4>Person-centred care</h4>
  <p>How can my colleagues and I work for person-centred care?</p>
  <p>- A life history should be documented for all those who give their consent. It is a good tool in helping to understand and handle behavioural problems.</p>
  <p>- With knowledge about each person, individual activities can be planned and documented so that everyone knows what to do.</p>
  <p>Checklist Dementia (only available in Swedish) can be used as a toll for following up each person according to the National Board for Health and Welfare’s guidelines for dementia care.</p>
<h4>Prevention</h4>
  <p>How can we stay one step ahead and work in a preventive manner to avoid behaviour that creates difficult situations?</p>
  <p>- Make sure that routines are available for each profession.  Who does what in a mapping and how is information shared between colleagues?</p>
  <p>- Establish routines for those responsible for regular assessments of the physical and psychosocial environment.</p>
  <p>- Make sure that the preventative methods are documented and that they are within easy reach.</p>
  <p>- Follow up the methods of prevention at regular staff meetings.</p>
  <h4>Interaction strategies</h4>
  <p>In spite of careful mapping of trigger mechanisms and working in a preventive manner, it can be difficult to completely prevent difficult situations from arising.  
    What shall I do if, nonetheless, difficult situations arise?</p>
  <p>- At staff meetings, discuss with your colleagues the needs of the person with dementia based on the mappings and the interaction strategies that have been established.</p>
  <p>- At staff reflection meetings, discuss situations where you see the need to evaluate and improve strategies e.g. shower or mealtime situations.</p>
  <p>- Establish routines for what is to be done in acute situations e.g. if someone becomes aggressive and begins to fight. Who does what if a person disappears from the residency/nursing home? It is a good idea to establish a plan of action.</p>
  <p>- Follow up interaction strategies regularly in your team. Do we follow the strategies? If not, why?</p>
