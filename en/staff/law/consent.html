<h2>Consent</h2>

  <p>The basis of health care and/or social services is that it should be voluntary and that the person consents to the treatment offered. There are various forms of consent. <i>Expressed consent</i> means that a person, actively in writing, orally or by a consenting nod gives their consent to a particular form of treatment.</p>
<p>Another form of consent is <i>Presumed consent</i>. This means that whoever carries out the health and/or social care assumes that the treatment is in accordance with the personâ€™s wishes even if consent has not been specifically expressed.</p>
  <p>In the early stages of dementia a person can, for example, specifically have pointed out that it is important for him/her to come out into the nature and to feel free. If, later, a person cannot give their consent to a GPS, it can be reasonable to assume that he/she would give their consent based on an earlier expressed wish.</p>
