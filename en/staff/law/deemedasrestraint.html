<h2>What is deemed as restraint?</h2>

<p>According to the law, all measures of care that are carried out <strong>against a person’s wishes</strong> are accounted as force or restraint. Here are examples of measures that can be deemed as restraint <strong>if the person does not give their consent:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using bed rails, seatbelts or tables that prevent a person from moving freely.</li>
  <li>Trying to control behaviour by holding on to a person.</li>
  <li>Locking a door and preventing a person from going where they want to.</li>
  <li>Using medication as a routine measure to sedate and keep a person calm.</li>  
</ul>

  <p>Electronic measures such as video surveillance, GPS, passive alarms such as movement detectors or electronic sound surveillance can be restraining <strong>if they are used against someone’s wishes.</strong> 
    If a person consents to these measures they can, instead, be good aids which lead to increased security and a sense of freedom.</p>
