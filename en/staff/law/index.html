<h2>Lorem ipsum</h2>

<p>A tray table is used on a wheelchair to prevent a woman with dementia from falling. In the afternoon a restless and anxious man is given a sedative when he wants to go to work. These are common situations that you can encounter at work.</p>

<p>Even if the intentions are good, these measures are not allowed if the persons in question do not give their consent. The law does not allow restraint. You must therefore work in a manner to prevent situations from arising that call for restraint as the only solution.</p>
