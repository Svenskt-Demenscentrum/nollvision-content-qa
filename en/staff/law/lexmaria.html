<h2>Lex Maria</h2>

  <p>Lex Maria is a law that states that healthcare professionals must report to The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) if a patient is afflicted by or risks being afflicted by a 
    serious care-related injury, e.g. incorrect medication or shortcomings in work routines and organisation.</p>
  <p>Within the County Council there is a person responsible for healthcare, usually the operational manager, who receives notifications of care-related injuries from care professionals, and subsequently reports them to IVO. Within municipal healthcare it is the so called MAS (Local Authority Senior Medicine Advisor) that has this responsibility. 
    The intention of Lex Maria is to find strategies to prevent and to avoid similar incidents from happening again.</p>
