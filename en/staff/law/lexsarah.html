<h2>Lex Sarah</h2>

  <p>Lex Sarah is a provision under the Social Services Act which means that whoever works within the social care sector must, by law, report adverse incident or the apparent risk of adverse incident. 
    Adverse incident can entail blows, harassment and insults.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings can be the lack of care such as help with personal hygiene or enough food and drink. When the staff use force or violence in an acute situation to protect a person or the surroundings it can be considered as adverse incident, according to Lex Sarah. 
  This should be reported to a senior member of staff who must carry out an inquiry.</p>
  <p>If the adverse incident is of a serious nature it should be reported to The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO). 
    The intention is not to look for scapegoats but to find ways of preventing similar situations in the future.</p>
