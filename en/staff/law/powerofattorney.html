<h2>Power of attorney</h2>

  <p>It is good to inform relatives of some of the practical issues when their next of kin is diagnosed with dementia. A general power of attorney will give the proxy owner the right to take care of practical matters. 
    In this way a relative or a friend can pay the bills and also look after the person’s interests.</p>
  <p>The power of attorney applies as long as the person with dementia has the ability to take in and understand information and communicate their own decisions. 
    When this no longer applies contact the council’s chief guardian and apply for a public trustee.</p>
  <p>It is also a good idea to make sure that the person with dementia has legitimate identity papers.</p>
