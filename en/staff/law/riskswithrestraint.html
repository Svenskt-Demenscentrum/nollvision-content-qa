<h2>Risks with restraint</h2>

<p>To be forced or restrained can affect a person in variety of ways. They can be perceived as offensive and influence a personâ€™s dignity, self-esteem and identity. 
  If someone is forced to sit or lie down for a long period of time it can result in a weakening of the muscles and poor balance.</p>
  <p>This in turn can lead to an increased risk for falling and injury. The belt can cause bruising and the blood circulation may be impaired. 
    Force and restraint can create frustration, aggression and result in apathy, anxiety and depression.</p>
