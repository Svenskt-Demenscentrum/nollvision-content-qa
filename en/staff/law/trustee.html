<h2>Trustee and administrator</h2>

  <p>A trustee is like a personâ€™s extended arm. He or she can give both help in making decisions and support in different situations. 
    The application must be sent to the District Court.</p>
  <p>The one who needs help decides whether he or she wants a trustee and can at any point in time terminate the trusteeship. 
    A medical certificate is needed if the person cannot speak for him/herself.</p>
  <p>Basically, an administrator helps in the same way as a trustee, but to be given an administrator is not always voluntary. 
    An administrator is designated by the District Court when a person needs to be protected from someone else or from her/himself.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the person in question has difficulty in understanding or of knowing what is best for them. A person with an administrator can no longer sign contracts by him/herself or buy things and pay by instalments. 
    An administrator does not need to get consent from the person in question.</p>
  <p>There must be strong reasons and an investigation carried out before the District Court can make a decision on trusteeship.</p>
  <p>No one, whether it is the trustee, administrator or next of kin, can make decisions regarding Social Services or Healthcare.</p>
