<h2>Irritated and angry</h2>

<p>"Billy’s in a wheelchair. You have said hello and then stand behind him. He gets angry and starts throwing himself about when you start to push the wheelchair. 
  It can be because Billy isn’t conscious of the fact that he is actually sitting in a wheelchair or that you stand behind him. The situation becomes frightening and he becomes afraid when the floor suddenly starts to move."</p>
<p>Brain damages caused by dementia can make it difficult for a person to concentrate, understand and interpret what is happening. It can be difficult to distinguish between all the different impressions and stimuli and this can cause tiredness and irritability.</p>
  <p>Many people with dementia are extra sensitive with regard to loud noises. There are of course lots of other reasons for a person to become irritated or angry.</p>
 <h4>Tips:</h4> 
<p>- Remember that irritation can be because he feels insulted.</p>
  <p>- Try and find out what has caused the behaviour. Are there any bodily reasons, e.g. pain or the need to go to the toilet or is it something else.</p>
  <p>- Avoid approaching someone suddenly or quickly. Be aware of your body language.</p>
  <p>- Avoid arguing or correcting. Ask questions one at a time and don’t give too much information at the same time.</p>
  <p>- Confirm feelings by saying: “I can see that you are angry”.</p>
  <p>- Offer something to eat or drink.</p>
  <p>- Try to distract with music or by talking about old times. Look in a photo album.</p>
  <p>- Prevent by removing whatever can cause irritation. Lower the volume or turn off the TV or radio.</p>
  <p>- If necessary, let a person be by him/herself for a while.</p>
