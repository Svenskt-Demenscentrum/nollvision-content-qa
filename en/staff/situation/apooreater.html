<h2>A poor eater</h2>

<p>David has a bad appetite. He doesnâ€™t seem to remember that he should eat or how to use cutlery.</p>
 <p>This could be because he has difficulty in interpreting impressions and recognising what is on the table, but also because he has difficulty in perceiving different smells and flavours (agnosia).</p>
  <p>It might also be that he no longer remembers how to eat, even though he is physically capable of doing so (apraxia). Is the problem caused by the dementia or by problems in the oral cavity?</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>
<p>- Examine the oral cavity. The problem may be caused by pain from a sore, a fungal infection or a damaged tooth.</p>
  <p>- Review the medicines. Some medication can cause gastritis or constipation, and others can have an effect on both taste and appetite.</p>
  <p>- Create peace and quiet during mealtimes. Turn off the TV, radio and dish washer.</p>
  <p>- Reduce the number of stimuli during mealtimes. Serve only one course at a time. Too many things on the table can cause confusion.</p>
  <p>- Serve food in an appetising way. Use contrasting colours, e.g. a coloured plate if white fish is served. It will then be easier to see the food.</p>
  <p>- Sit and eat together. If the person sees how and what you do, it can be easier to do the same thing.</p>
  <p>- Avoid asking a lot of questions or talking too much, in order not to disturb concentration.</p>
  <p>- Offer texture-modified food and smaller snacks such as fruit, biscuits, smoothies, ice cream or a sandwich.</p>
  <p>What strategies do you have for helping a person to eat better?</p>
