<h2>Delusions</h2>

<p>"Elsa says that someone has taken her wallet and you feel accused of having taken it."</p>
  <p>When suffering from dementia it is not unusual to have delusions. Believing that people hide or steal things, that someone has poisoned the food are some examples of delusion. 
    A person can also believe that their partner is unfaithful, misinterpret their surroundings and also others behaviour.</p>

  <h4>Tips:</h4>
  <p>- Look for the wallet together. Start talking about something else after a while to distract her.</p>
  <p>- Remember, a delusion is real for the person, even if you know that it’s not true. This makes it almost impossible to convince someone by using logic or rational explanations.</p>
  <p>- Ask: “What’s disappeared? I’ll go and check that out”. Or: “I’ve written that up and I’ll take care of it”. In this way you take over the responsibility and perhaps she’ll calm down.</p>
  <p>- If the delusions are difficult to cope with, contact a doctor for an assessment.</p>
  <p>- Talk to your colleagues on how to handle the situation. Together you may be able to find a strategy that helps.</p>

  <p>What would you do if Elsa accused you of having taken her wallet?</p>
