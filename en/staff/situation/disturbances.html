<h2>Sleep disorders</h2>

<p>Anna has trouble sleeping and wakes up several times during the night. She often gets dressed to go out, and says that she is on her way to work</p>
  <p>A person with dementia can sometimes have trouble separating night from day.</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>
  <p>- Try to find out the reason for not being able to sleep: Aches or pains? Too cold? Disturbing noises? Hungry? Need to go to the toilet?</p>
<p>- Gone to bed too early? What was the usual bedtime earlier in life?</p>
  <p>- Perhaps she wants to go “home”, which in her world could be her childhood home. 
    Show her that it’s dark outside and tell her that she can’t go out at night. A custom made watch and/or clock or electronic calendar can show if it is day or night.</p>
  <p>- Prepare bedtime by lowering the lighting and surrounding sounds.</p>
  <p>- Try tactile massage and/or lubricate her hands and feet.</p>
  <p>- Listen to soft music, hum or sing together.</p>
  <p>- Watch TV if it is calming but be aware that what is shown can be confusing and cause anxiety.</p>
  <p>- A ball-blanket (a weighted blanket) can be comforting.</p>
  <p>- Try a wheat cushion, heating pad or a cuddly toy.</p>
  <p>What do you usually do to find out about a person’s previous sleeping habits?</p>
