<h2>Hallucinations</h2>

<p>Eric talks to someone who seems to irritate him. He waves his arms around as if trying to push the person away.</p>
  <p>Visual hallucinations can occur with dementia and are often due to the damaged brain. 
    For some people with dementia hallucinations are not unpleasant. Contact a doctor if the hallucinations frighten, worry or in any other way disturb him, or if you believe that he is in an acute state of confusion.</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>

  <p>- Some people can be conscious of the fact that they have hallucinations. In such cases you can say ”I understand that you see something, but I can’t see it”.</p>
<p>- Others are unconscious of the hallucinations and perceive them as real. In these cases it is futile to disagree. Listen instead and confirm the perception: “I understand that you don’t like the animals. Shall we go away from here?”</p>
  <p>- Confirm the feeling but not the actual hallucination:” I can see that you are frightened, how can I help you?”</p>
  <p>- Discuss with your colleagues on how best to deal with the situation.</p>
  <p>- What do you usually do when a person has hallucinations?</p>
