<h2>Calling out and shouting</h2>

<p>Emma shouts right out, loud. Sometimes she calls for help and sometimes for her mother.</p>
  <p>Hearing someone shout or scream can be both disturbing and annoying but a person with dementia is not always aware that they are doing so. Pain, as the cause, must be excluded first. A feeling of loneliness or abandonment may also be the cause.</p>
<h4>Tips:</h4>
  <p>- Make sure that it is not caused by pain or other discomfort.</p>
  <p>- Acknowledge the person, say “I’m here and I see you”. Tell the person that you’ll be back if you have to leave for a while.</p>
  <p>- Be close by and, if she appreciates it, give her some foot and hand massage, or try tactile massage.</p>
  <p>- Pamper the person in a way that she likes.</p>
  <p>- Help her to feel a part of the group. Do something you know she likes doing.</p>
  <p>- Reduce the number of impressions and stimuli. A damaged brain needs more rest than a healthy brain. Suggest a rest in the middle of the day.</p>
  <p>- Go for a walk or do something else that will cause a distraction.</p>
  <p>- Listen to her favourite music, perhaps with headphones.</p>

  <p>What do you usually do when a person shouts, screams or calls out nonstop?
       How do you try to prevent this behaviour?</p>
