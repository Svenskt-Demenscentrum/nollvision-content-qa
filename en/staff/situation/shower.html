<h2>Refuses to shower</h2>

<p>Earlier in life, George was always meticulous with his personal hygiene. Now he refuses to shower.</p>
<p>There can be many reasons why a person refuses to take a shower, for instance a cold bathroom or feeling ashamed of being seen naked.</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>
  <p>- Avoid direct questions like: “Do you want to take a shower?” He may no longer know what “shower” means, and if he doesn’t understand the question he will probably answer no.</p>
  <p>- Try to offer something to eat before the shower or entice him with a good breakfast afterwards.</p>
  <p>- Make sure the bathroom is warm by letting the warm water run for a while before going in there.</p>
  <p>- Be calm and make sure you have plenty of time and that no one disturbs you. Plan ahead so that everything you need is close at hand. Work slowly and don’t rush the person.</p>
  <p>- Use the same showering routines, but adjust the situation according to the present mood. If it’s not possible to carry out the showering today, try again tomorrow.</p>
  <p>- Entice him by smelling an after shave that he likes and saying “It’s probably better if you wash yourself a little before you put this nice smell on”.</p>
  <p>- Let him keep his underwear on in the shower, if he won’t take them off. Maybe he will take off the wet underwear during the shower.</p>

  <p>Put yourself in George’s position. How would you feel if someone offered to give you a shower?</p>
