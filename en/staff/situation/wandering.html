<h2>Pacing/fiddling with things</h2>

<p>James paces anxiously and in a disturbing manner. He pulls at door handles and moves furniture around.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of those who aimlessly pace feel better doing so, and it’s important that they continue doing it. Remember that if this is the case, they need extra food, and not the least, good shoes. 
  Lack of stimulation, and confusion with time and place, can cause restlessness and worry.</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>
  <p>- Try different ways of calming and stimulating the person.</p>
  <p>- Make an “activity box”, e.g. with tools, fabrics, a yo-yo or balls, that can be used whenever necessary.</p>
  <p>- Photographs, with information on the backside so that it will be easier to talk about what’s in them.</p>
  <p>- Take out some laundry to fold. The important thing is to catch interest and not what the result will be.</p>
  <p>- Play the person’s favourite music.</p>
  <p>- Offer contact with an animal or with a cuddly toy like a dog or cat.</p>
  <p>- Offer extra food and drink to create a few moments rest.</p>
  <p>- Give hand or foot massage or some other physical contact, like sitting close to the person. A warm wheat cushion on the feet, neck or stomach can be comforting and calming.</p>
<p>How do you prevent anxious behaviour? Have you tried anything else that has worked well?</p>
